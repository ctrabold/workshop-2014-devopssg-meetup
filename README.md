Summary:

With agile software development, building software is often no longer the bottleneck. More often than not, the bottleneck is in getting that software production. Continuous Delivery aims to address the “last mile” software houses often have.

In this talk, we will explore some of the ideas behind Continuous Delivery. Leave this tutorial with a greater set of skills to apply in your own organisations.

Participants should bring laptops (all platforms supported) for part of the session for the hands­-on practice if possible.

After this tutorial, we expect participants can:

    Describe what Continuous Delivery is
    Draw the organisational support required for successful Continuous Delivery
    Setup a build pipeline
    Identify and add stages to a build pipeline
    Describe the impact Continuous Delivery as on other aspects to the software process
    List out tools that can help automate infrastructure
    Describe strategies for safe roll­outs
    Identify data migration strategies
    Describe a set of anti­patterns for Continuous Delivery
