# Continuous deployment is a process

"Whereby all code that is written for an application is immediately deployed into production, which results in a reduction of cycle time."
– Eric Ries (Lean Startup)


A bad system will beat a good person every time
– W. Edwards Deming, Author of “Out of Crisis”
